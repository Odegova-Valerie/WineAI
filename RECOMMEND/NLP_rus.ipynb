DescriptionTerroir: Prunotto Roero Arneis DOCG wine is produced from the Arneis grape variety, which is native to Piedmont. Arneis is most commonly found in the Roero mountains, northwest of Alba. Aging: In stainless steel containers at low temperatures for several months. Vinification: Only the best grapes were selected, which is of fundamental importance to obtain a quality drink. The grapes were carefully collected in baskets and sent to the winery, where they were gently pressed to separate the clarified juices and cold static setting. Fermentation took place at a temperature not exceeding 18 ° C for approximately 15 days. Tasting characteristics Color: Straw yellow with a greenish tint. Aroma: Represented by a harmonious interweaving of shades of ripe peach, apricot, melon, pear, spring flowers and minerals. Taste: Bright, fresh , juicy with a smooth texture, mouth-watering, crisp acidity, fruity citrus notes and a mineral finish. This is interesting \"Arneis\" literally means \"little rascal\", the grape is so called because it is quite difficult to grow. Chicken, Pasta, Risotto, Fish'"

DescriptionTerroir: Prunotto Roero Arneis DOCG wine is produced from the Arneis grape variety, which is native to Piedmont. Arneis is most commonly found in the Roero mountains, northwest of Alba. Aging: In stainless steel containers at low temperatures for several months. Vinification: Only the best grapes were selected, which is of fundamental importance to obtain a quality drink. The grapes were carefully collected in baskets and sent to the winery, where they were gently pressed to separate the clarified juices and cold static setting. Fermentation took place at a temperature not exceeding 18 ° C for approximately 15 days. Tasting characteristics Color: Straw yellow with a greenish tint. Aroma: Represented by a harmonious interweaving of shades of ripe peach, apricot, melon, pear, spring flowers and minerals. Taste: Bright, fresh , juicy with a smooth texture, mouth-watering, crisp acidity, fruity citrus notes and a mineral finish. This is interesting \"Arneis\" literally means \"little rascal\", the grape is so called because it is quite difficult to grow. Chicken, Pasta, Risotto, Fish')\n",

      "Наиболее похожий отзыв: A warm day of young autumn fills a glass with its light, you inhale the smell of flowers, walking along a country road, put your hand in your pocket and take out a toffee, unwrap it, and the new smell already interrupts the flowers, and then put it in your mouth and drink water - it knocks down the sweetness - and for a long time you dissolve it. Stunningly.Rich in a shaking and quite authentic wine, I liked the pleasant aroma and bright pleasant aftertaste, but it seemed sweet. It is not suitable for marine products, it is more suitable for snacks and desserts.Moderately acidic, pleasant, light, I will not say that it is powerful. I definitely enjoyed it!Bright aroma and taste are in development. Long aftertaste. It would be clean and harmonious, but there is not enough acidity. Interesting!The aroma is balanced, the taste is bright and saturated. That's right, the taste is better than the aroma!Excellent wine in its price segment has a brilliant golden color, the aroma of summer flowers, acacia and melon. Great with salads in the summer heat!I really like wines from the falangina grape variety. excellent value for money of the wine. Falangina wine is not so common in Russian stores. Wine style: white — light, refreshing, not aged in oak Tasting characteristics: The color is straw yellow with a bright sheen. Pure, clear floral and fruity aromas. Pleasant, refreshing and mild in taste. Gastronomy: Serve as an aperitif, as well as with daily seafood and vegetable dishes. Vineyards: More than 300 hectares are located on hills 350-700 m above sea level. Soils: volcanic origin, limestone. The method of exposure: For 4 months in stainless steel containers. Production method: Fermentation in steel tanks at a controlled temperature of 16-18 ° C. Label History: The winemakers of Feudi di San Gregorio believe that wine and a work of art share a similar creative process. To emphasize the individuality of each wine, Italian designer Massimo Vignelli created a recognizable label design. Mosaics with deep colors and golden letters remind of the greatness of Italian art at all times. Some of them are related to the finds of archaeologists at the site of the ancient eruption of Vesuvius — after all, it is here that Feudi di San Gregorio create their wines. “I like the design to be visually powerful, intellectually elegant and, above all, timeless,” Vignelli notes. He seems to have succeeded. It is interesting: Falangina is an autochthon of the Campania region, almost 90% of the vineyards of this variety are located here. Falangina chose the place for a reason — a beautiful and climatically impeccable region on the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea was attractive for life even before our era — the Roman nobility built their mosaic villas here. That's why there are so many ancient varieties in the Campaign. Today, world wine critics consider Campania to be one of the most interesting Italian wine regions. According to the annual rankings, 5-6 of the best Italian whites will always come from here. Fish, Seafood\n"
